It is paramount that all these components of a repo are rock-solid:

- The `README.md` file should be very informative
- The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file or any other file that explains how to contribute should be crystal clear and easy to understand
- The way an issue is described and considered as done should be very clear and easy to understand
- Setting up the project and the tooling should be easy and straightforward
