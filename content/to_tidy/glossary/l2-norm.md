The L2 norm, or _Root Mean Squared Error_ takes the mean of the square of differences (which makes everything positive) between data points and then takes the square root of that.

The main difference between L1 norm and MSE is that the latter will penalize bigger mistakes more heavily than the former, which may be more lenient with small mistakes.
