A python tuple is an immutable ordered list. It is defined with `()` and can be accessed with `[]`.

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
my_tuple[0] #1
```

_Immutable_ means that once a tuple is created, it cannot be changed. You can't add, remove or change elements of a tuple. You can only access them.

Python tuples allow for duplicate elements and can contain different data types.
