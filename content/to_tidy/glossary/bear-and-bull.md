_Bear_ and _Bull_ are terms that describe market conditions or the sentiment of investors.

A _bear market_ is a market where the prices are going down or are expected to fall. A _bull market_ is a market where the prices are going up or are expected to rise.

A Bull market is often associated with market conditions such as low unemployment, high consumer spending, and strong corporate profits. A classical Bull market strategy would be to buy and hold stocks to benefit from rising prices.

A Bear market will often show that investors are selling off stocks or are buying stocks at lower prices in hopes of making a profit later on re selling them when the prices go up again.
