`pnpm` is a fast, disk space efficient package manager for Node.js modules. It uses a unique approach to package management called "linking" which allows multiple projects to share the same module instance. This can result in significant disk space savings and faster installation times.

To install `pnpm`, all you need to do is run `npm install -g pnpm`. You can then use `pnpm` just like you would use `npm`.
