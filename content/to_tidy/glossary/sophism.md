term: 'sophism'
---

This term originates from the ancient Greek Sophists, who were known for their skill in persuasive argumentation, often using clever but misleading reasoning. _Sophism_ refers to a form of argument that is seemingly plausible, but is actually misleading or fallacious. It is often associated with deceptive reasoning or rhetoric that is used to deceive someone. Sophism is about the intent and the method of argumentation. It implies a deliberate attempt to mislead or deceive through complex but flawed arguments.

We can distribute sophisms into a few categories:

## Ambiguous sophisms

This type of sophism uses ambiguous language to mislead the audience.

## Inductive argumentations

This type of sophism makes hasty generalizations. This is when an inductive argument goes wrong.

This type of sophism is used a lot in adversiting (sampling bias).

One of the difficulties of inductive reasoning resides in the fact that there is no single criterion that can be used to evaluate the strength of an inductive argument.

## Non causa pro causa

This type of sophism deliberately confuses correlation and causality.

## Relevancy

Calls for novelty, ad hominem attacks, and appeals to authority are all examples of this type of sophism.
