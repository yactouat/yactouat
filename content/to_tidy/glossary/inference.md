When you go from proposition A to proposition B, with B supposed to be derived from A, you are making an _inference_.

You cannot have inference with unrelated propositions.

There are 3 types of inference:

- abduction
- deduction
- induction

Every inference type has its type of fallacies:

- for deductive reasoning, it would be _affirming the consequent_; for instance, "if it rains, the ground is wet; the ground is wet, therefore it rains"
- for induction, it would be _hasty generalization_; for instance, "I have seen 3 white swans, therefore all swans are white"
- for abduction, it would be _ad hoc hypotheses_; for instance, "I have a headache, therefore I have a brain tumor"

## Abduction

Abduction, or inference to the best explanation, is drawing a conclusion based on the explanation that best explains a state of events, rather than from evidence provided by premises.

Abduction is reasoning in termes of _why_ questions.

It consists of formulating hypotheses to explain a phenomenon. It starts with an observation, and seeks the simplest and most likely explanation for it.

Abductive reasoning is by nature creative and requires a fair amount of intuition. Charles Sanders Peirce, who coined the term in the 19th century, described it as "guessing". He also said that it is the only logical operation which introduces any new idea.

For Peirce, abduction is the starting point of the scientific method, where after a hypothesis is abduced, it can be tested through induction and deduced for implications. Scientifical hypotheses are abduced from observations.

During the abductive process, you will rule out what can't be true and what can. Abduction uses the predictibility of Nature to make the best guesses possible, so there is no guarantee that the conclusion is true.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, via Sherlock Holmes, has given a great explanation of inductive reasoning like so:

```
When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
```

Good abductive explanations have 2 characteristics:

- the more an explanation fits with what we already know, the better it tends to be
- a simple explanation is better than a complicated one

One way to challenge an abductive argument is to come up with a better explanation on the data we already have.

The more verified data you have, the more your abductive reasoning will be reliable.

## Deduction

It consists of going from a general statement to a specific statement.

In deductive reasoning, the starting point is the _rule_.

Deductive arguments reach limits when the World around fails to be explained with deductive proof with a fair amount of information that allows to make a specific conclusion.

## Induction

It consists of going from a specific statement to a general statement.

Using past experience to make future predictions is part of induction. The limits of inductive reasoning lie in the fact that past observed conditions can cease to be true.

Inductive premises only mean that the conclusion is likely to be true. Induction does not work with certainty, but with probabilities. This means that induction can always lead to false results.

As of 2023, AI does most of its reasoning through induction.
