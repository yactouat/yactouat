In day-to-day conversations, an argument is often composed of one argument for brevity.

Sometimes, it's legitimate to skip premises because of a consensus on a given subject. But sometimes, errors can be hidden in these skipped premises.

You will often find flaws in an argument within the hidden premises. As soon as you find out that a hidden premise is false, it's easy to deconstruct an argument.
