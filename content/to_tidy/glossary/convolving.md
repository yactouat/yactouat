In the context of deep learning, particularly in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), _convolving_ an image refers to the process of applying a filter, also known as a kernel, to an image in order to extract features like edges, shapes, or textures. This process helps the network learn from the visual data in a hierarchical manner, understanding simple features first and then combining them to understand more complex features.
