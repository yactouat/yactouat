excerpt: Escaping the code cemetery is a hard thing to do. I've been trying to do this for years. Launching this blog is my latest attempt in that direction. Hope it will spark something nice! Following a ship-it mentality, I'm launching it with a simple post. I'll be improving this application and writing about my experiences as a software developer, and other things that I find interesting as I go along.

title: escaping the code cemetery
---

About two years ago, I joined [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com) as a mentor. I've been mentoring students on their path to becoming software developers since then. Some of them are really cut out for this, some others are struggling, and some even give up after a few months of grinding. Either way, most of them are better than me I think. It is so for a very simple reason: most of them finish whatever project they're working on. They ship it. They don't let their code rot in the code cemetery. Not like I've been doing for the past six years (I've started coding in 2018).

Sure, I've had a lot on my plate and being on a paid developer job is quite challenging, the grind is real, but come one dude, seriously? Six years? When I tell my students about my software graveyard and share my screen to show them the enormous string of half-baked half-started projects I've been working on, they realize:

- I've learned tons of stuff
- they shouldn't do like me, (I regularly implore them to avoid that direction)

In the end, I think I have actually been teaching mostly to me while I was interacting with the students, and today it clicked. I've often heard myself say stuff like:

- "This is not the current scope of the project, let's focus on what's important"
- "Do you rather have a working existing project or a perfect failed project?"
- "At your level, it's perfectly ok to make these little mistakes, the project still looks great!"
- "You should establish a roadmap for your project, itemize the features, and focus on one at a time"
- etc.

What I found most suprising is that I'm trying to do that at work a well, with some degree of success. Fine, succeeding at work is a matter of survival, times are rough and if I didn't follow my own advice, things would be dire right now. 

So why not applying this sound advice to me for the love of building stuff (which was initially the reason I chose this carreer path)? Anyway, launching this blog, at this new era ushered by the AI boom, is I think a good signal that I'm finally getting out of the code cemetery.

I'll be digging and scavenging into these old codebases and integrate new AI-powered stuff into it; whatever I do, I'll make sure this actually solves a problem, whether personal, like the one I just told you about, or technical: stay tuned!
