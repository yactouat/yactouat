## why SEO?

Why would you want visitors to come to your website? among usual reasons you may find:

- making more sells
- getting more sales leads
- branding and expert positioning
- recruiting
- etc.

Depending on your goals, your KPIs of interest will be different:

- number of unique visitors
- number of page views
- conversion rate on registration, payment, etc. forms
- recurring visitors
- etc.

Sometimes, more traffic is not the solution. For example, if you have a high bounce rate, it means that your visitors are not interested in your content. In this case, you should focus on improving your content, rather than increasing your traffic.

Today, Google is still the undisputed leader of search engines, with a market share of 91.54% worldwide (in 2023). This cie has set various standards for the web, that became de facto rules for web developers. So, if you want your website to have visitors, whether for fame or for business, you have to play by Google's rules and make your website SEO friendly. Remember: every visitor of your website is a potential customer.

Humans and algorithms will evaluate your website on many criteria, among them:

- **authorativeness**: is your website a reliable source of information? for instance, does it have quality backlinks?
- **popularity**: is your website popular?
- **optimized**: is your website optimized for search engines?

SEO is a cheap way of increasing your traffic. It's actually a good strategy to optimize your website and THEN add ads to it, this will maximize your investment (since ads are paid per click).

## Map out the competition: the importance of keywords

Very basic questions you ask yourself are:

- who's first on Google for your keywords?
- what kind of content do they have?

As a general rule of thumb, if your keywords:

- have 0 to 500 000 results, your competition is low
- have 500 000 to 1 000 000 results, your competition is medium
- have more than 1 000 000 results, your competition is high

Let's try to find my own keywords, this will be a fun exercise: what are my motivations for writing this blog? Actually, I have no clue, let's use my own personal digital shrink, ChatGPT, to find out:

```markdown
me: I've just built a developer blog, help me find the correct keywords to use for my SEO
```

The bot came up with a few intersting questions:

- what specific topics in software and development do I want to cover? mmmm, let's say: web development, AI, tech, problem solving, and software engineering. But this is not enough, I want also this blog to be a place where I can share my thoughts about other stuff, as a contemporary fellow living in such fascinating times. So, I've went on with another prompt:

```markdown
how would you call the topic, for an SEO keyword, of someone who is deeply enthusiastic about the future and what technology can bring? also, if this is not encompassed in the same keyword, I want to surface the idea that this someone is interested in business, ethics, and the fighting of injustice and intolerance ?
```

... phew, what a mouthful ! I didn't expect working on refreshing my SEO would take me that deep. Anyway I think `futurist` would be a good fit to express the above idea, let's add in another adjective to this keyword: `optimistic futurist`.

Alright, let's update the website accordingly. I'll update my personal presentation on this site, this repo (this is the GitHub Readme repo) and various social media accounts to include these keywords:

- `optimistic futurist`
- `problem solving`
- `tech`
- `AI`
- `software engineering`
- `web development`

## Seek out partners

Having backlinks from other websites is a good way to increase your authorativeness. You need to network and find partners that will link to your website.

## What happens after I've improved my SEO?

You need to wait for Google's bots to crawl your webite and index it again. This can happen within a few days to a few weeks. You can check if your website has been indexed by searching for `site:yourwebsite.com` on Google.

After that first re indexation, you can expect to see your website's ranking improve a bit. But significant changes will only happen after a few months, when Google will have crawled your website again and again, and will have seen that your website is still relevant.

## Some tools you can test drive while sorting out your SEO

- Google Search Console and its wonderful documentation
- Google Trends
