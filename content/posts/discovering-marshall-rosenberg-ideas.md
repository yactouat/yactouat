excerpt: I read something quite interesting about non violent communication methods, and I've learned Marshall Rosenberg is the name of the man who theorized them, so I'm dumping my notes to share them with you here.

title: discovering and experimenting Marshall Rosenberg ideas
---

Sometimes you end up discussing late at work with your colleagues, and at some point it appears obvious that the people you are talking to are not just about logs, architecture diagrams, Azure DevOps tickets, and CI/CD pipelines. They are also human beings, with their own feelings, emotions, and needs. Yesterday I had a fascinating talk about how you would approach communicating with colleague X or Y, with an approach based on the person's specificities. While I find this approach sensible and designed to have great interactions, I was wondering if it existed a more general approach to communication, so I came across Marshall Rosenberg's ideas.

This American psychologist theorized, in the Seventies, a four-part process of  _NVC_ (Non Violent Communication), and I found them quite interesting:

- observation: enounce facts as objectively as possible and without judgment; the purpose of this step is to start a conversation from a neutral non-confrontational place
- feelings: express your feelings precisely and frankly about what you have observed, without blame, criticism, or judgment; this can help your interlocutor to understand your perspective and to create empathy
- needs: express your needs clearly after having stated your feelings, this step prepares the next one, which is finind a solution to a potential conflict
- request: make a clear request to your interlocutor; the request must be clear, specific, and doable, be careful of not turning this request into a demand and leave your interlocutor with the ability to agree, negotiate, or decline; also, it's a good practice to leave the interlocutor with alternatives

Each step builds on the previous one. These simple principles may unlock a lot of fruitful interactions. As I consider my work as a playground for my soft skills, I'm going to try to apply these principles in my daily work, and I'll let you know how it goes. The whole idea behing this framework is to provide tools for conflict resolution. To be able to use it, you need to be willing to be empathetic, e.g. understand other people's feelings and needs. I will personally use it to improve the quality of my interactions with other human beings.
