A histogram is a type of chart that represents the distribution of numerical data. It works by dividing the entire range of values into a series of intervals (also known as _bins_), and then counting how many values fall into each interval. The intervals are adjacent and often of equal size.

Histograms can be used to:

- get a visual idea of the distribution of a data feature
- identify outliers
- understand central tendency and dispersion in a data feature
