_Leading the answer_ typically refers to the practice of guiding or influencing someone towards a specific response or conclusion, often through the way questions are asked or information is presented. This can happen in various contexts, such as interviews, surveys, or casual conversations.

For instance, in a survey, a question like "How much did you enjoy our excellent service?" leads the answer by implying that the service was excellent, which might prompt respondents to give a more favorable response than they would if asked a more neutral question like "How would you rate our service?"
