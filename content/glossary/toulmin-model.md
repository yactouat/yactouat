The Toulmin model is an argument analysis method. It deconstructs an argument into:

- data...
- ... that leads to a claim
- some kind of warrant and a basis for the argument help the transition from the data to the claim

A _warrant_ typically starts with "since..." or "because...". It's a statement that links the data to the claim. It answers the question: "how do you get evidence from your claim?".

A strength adverb is often used to facilitate the transition from data to claim. 

The Toulmin model also notes that arguments can be nuanced with a reservation component, that can somehow have the effect of strengthening the argument.

The Toulmin model sheds light on the fact that is easy to manipulate the components of an argument to mislead the audience, even if its data is true or any other component is true.
