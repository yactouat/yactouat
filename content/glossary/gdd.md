Also, you will list what sprites you will need for the game.

## The game's concept

This part specifies the genre of the game.

## The game's mechanics

This answers questions such as: 

- "How does the game work?"
- "How do you win the game?"
- "What are the possible interactions?"
- "What is the journey of the player?"

## The game's platforms

This specifies on which device the game will be played.

Also, it specifies if it's a browser game, a mobile game, a desktop game, etc.

## The game's UI and controls

You can also specify in the document how the playable character(s) moves.
