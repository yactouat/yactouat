An _argument_ is a series of statements, or premises, that lead to a final statement, which is called the conclusion.

You will often see arguments in support of other arguments.

## Deductive argument

A _deductive argument_ (Modus ponens) starts with a conditional premise:

```
if x, then y
x
therefore, y
```

```
if it rains, then the ground is wet
---
it rained, so the ground is wet
```

In a deductive argument, you will always have:

- the antecedent
- the implication
- the consequent

### Validity vs Correctness

When it's impossible for an argument to be true while the conclusion is false, then the argument is _valid_ (the premises _entail_ the conclusion). _Validity_ is all about the relationship between an argument's premises and its conclusion. An argument is valid if and only if the truth of its premises guarantees the truth of its conclusion.

A valid argument with true premises is called _sound_. An argument can be valid but incorrect when its premises are false, so being valid should not be the objective of an argument. Instead, we should aim at making sound arguments. _Soundness_ applies only to deductive arguments. If we know that an argument is sound, then we know that its conclusion is true.

However, the truth of the argument's premises does not necessarily entail the truth of its conclusion. An argument can be unsound even if its premises and conclusion are true when the conclusion is not a logical consequence of the premises (_non sequitur_).

To check the validity of an argument, you can try to find counterexamples from a case, either real or hypothetical, where the argument's premises are true but the conclusion is false.

A _fallacy_ happens when an argument is invalid.

Let's represent how arguments can be sound this with a matrix:

|                   | All premises are true | Not all premises are true |
|-------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Valid reasoning   | ✅                    | ❌                        |
| Invalid reasoning | ❌                    | ❌                        |

### Valid vs Truth

Validity is a property of arguments.

Truth is a property of statements.
