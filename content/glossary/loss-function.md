In deep learning, the loss function measures the difference between the model's predictions and the true labels in the training data. The loss function will return a value based on the given predictions and targets, where lower values correspond to better model predictions.

It provides a metric to evaluate how well the model is performing.

The _loss_ is what is used to provide a better set of weights to the model, e.g. the model should aim at making the loss smaller.

A good loss function is a loss function that would respond to small changes in confidence level.
