A fallacy is a defect in reasoning. This defect can be unintentional or intentional.

We distinguish formal and informal fallacies.

## Formal fallacies

Formal fallacies concern deductive arguments, informal fallacies concern all other arguments.

### Affirming the consequent

One famous formal fallacy is the _affirming the consequent_ fallacy:

```
if P then Q; Q, therefore P
```

```
if it rains, the ground is wet; the ground is wet, therefore it rains
```

```
if I am at the beach, then I am happy; I am happy, therefore I am at the beach
```

The fallacy of affirming the consequent happens when you flip deductive arguments. It's a formal fallacy because it's a defect in the form of the argument. Any argument of this form will be invalid.

### Denying the antecedent

`It is not raining, therefore the ground is not wet.` 

## Informal fallacies

Informal fallacies are harder to spot. They arise out of the content of the argument, not its form, which often seems valid at first glance in these types of fallacies.

### Ad hominem fallacy

An _ad hominem_ fallacy is a personal attack on the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself.

### Appeal to emotion fallacy

An _appeal to emotion_ fallacy is an attempt to manipulate the audience's emotions in order to win an argument, rather than using logical reasoning.

### Appeal to ignorance fallacy

"If you can't prove it's false, it must be true." => it is an informal fallacy since this type of reasoning does not follow a logical structure.

### Appeal to nature fallacy

The appeal to nature fallacy is a logical fallacy that occurs when something is claimed to be good or preferable because it is perceived as natural, or bad and undesirable because it is considered unnatural. This fallacy is based on the assumption that the natural state of things is inherently better or more moral than the unnatural.

### Appeal to popularity fallacy

An _appeal to popularity_ fallacy is an attempt to win an argument by appealing to the popularity of the argument's conclusion, rather than using logical reasoning.

### Appeal to tradition fallacy

An _appeal to tradition_ fallacy is an attempt to win an argument by appealing to the tradition of the argument's conclusion, rather than using logical reasoning.

### Begging the question (assume the initial point) fallacy

Begging the question is assuming that a premise that you are trying to prove is true. It's a circular argument.

### Burden of proof fallacy

It assumes that is the responsibility of the other party to prove that your argument is wrong when it should be the other way around.

### Decision point fallacy

It consists of assuming that a decision point is binary, when in fact there are more options.

The _decision point fallacy_ is a logical fallacy that occurs when someone argues that because a process doesn't have a clear or precise point at which a significant change occurs, there are no significant differences along the process. This fallacy is often used to argue against a position by claiming that because there's no clear "line" or "point" where a significant change happens, the entire process or the distinctions it involves are invalid.

To understand this with a simple example, consider the process of aging. Let's say someone argues, "There's no exact moment when a person becomes 'old.' Therefore, there's no real difference between being young and being old." This is a decision point fallacy because it ignores the gradual and significant changes that occur over time, even if there isn't a precise moment when someone transitions from 'young' to 'old.'

In the context of software development, you might encounter a similar argument about system upgrades or changes. For instance, someone might argue, "There's no specific point at which a software update significantly improves the system, so all updates are essentially the same." This argument overlooks the incremental improvements and changes that each update brings, even though there might not be a single, defining update that revolutionizes the system.

The fallacy lies in the oversimplification of a continuous process, ignoring the nuances and gradual changes that occur over time.

### Equivocation fallacy

It consists of using one word with two different meanings in the same argument.

### Fallacious appeal to authority

Using the authority of an entirely unrelated field expert to support an argument.

### Fallacy fallacy

It consists of assuming that because an argument is fallacious, its conclusion is false.

### Fallacy of composition

"If it's true of some parts, it's true of the whole." => it is an informal fallacy since this type of reasoning does not follow a logical structure.

### Fallacy of division

"If it's true of the whole, it's true of the parts."

### False cause fallacy

It consists of assuming that because two things are correlated, one causes the other.

### False dichotomy fallacy

It consists of presenting two options as the only two options, when in fact there are more.

### Faulty analogy fallacy

It consists of comparing two things that are not comparable.

### Gambler's fallacy

The Gambler's Fallacy is a common misconception related to probability and randomness, particularly relevant in scenarios like gambling.

Imagine you're flipping a fair coin, which has an equal chance of landing on heads or tails. Each flip is an independent event, meaning the outcome of one flip does not influence the outcome of the next.

Now, let's say you flip the coin five times, and each time it lands on heads. The Gambler's Fallacy would be to think, "It's landed on heads five times in a row, so it's more likely to land on tails the next time."

However, this is a misconception. Since each coin flip is independent, the probability of getting tails on the next flip remains 50%, regardless of previous results. The fallacy lies in the belief that previous outcomes affect future ones in independent events, which is not true in scenarios like coin flips or roulette spins.

### Genetic fallacy

It consists of assuming that an argument is wrong because of where it came from, or who it came from.

### Hasty generalization fallacy (or anecdotal fallacy)

It consists of drawing a conclusion from a small sample size.

### Loaded question fallacy

It consists of asking a question that contains a controversial or unjustified assumption.

### Middle ground fallacy

It consists of assuming that the middle ground between two extremes is the truth.

### Moving the goalposts fallacy

It consists of changing the criteria of an argument after the argument has been made.

### No true Scotsman fallacy

It consists of redefining a term in order to exclude a counterexample.

### Personal Increduility fallacy

It consists of assuming that because you don't understand something, it must be false.

### Red herring fallacy

It's a fallacy of distraction. It consists of diverting attention away from the main argument by introducing an unrelated topic.

### Slippery slope fallacy

It consists of assuming that a small step towards a direction will inevitably lead to a big step in that direction.

### Strawman fallacy

It consists of willfully misrepresenting an argument by awfully hyperbolizing it.

### Tu quoque fallacy

 It occurs when someone attempts to invalidate someone else's argument by asserting that the person is being hypocritical or has inconsistencies in their own behavior.
