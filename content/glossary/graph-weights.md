Adding weights to a graph edge is a way to represent additional information about the edge, such as the distance between two nodes or the cost of traversing the edge.

For instance, the weight could represent the number of routes between two destinations. This information can be used to calculate the shortest path between two nodes or to perform other graph algorithms that take edge weights into account.
