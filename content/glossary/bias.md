A _bias_ is a value that is added to the parameters of a model to compensate the fact that the input may be 0.

This add flexibility to the model because it allows a neuron to have some output even when the input is 0 (meaning "absence of a specific input").

Together, the _weights_ and the _bias_ are called the _parameters_ of the model.
