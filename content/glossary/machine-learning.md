In a nutshell, machine learning is about building predictive models, e.g. extracting from data rules that generalize to new observations.

Machine learning involves matrices of data, or data represented as numbers, that can be used to build mathematical rules that set apart different classes within this data. This means that the first step of any machine learning process is to represent data as numbers.

In these data matrices, rows will be called _samples_ and columns will be called _features_.

You will often want to build predictive rules to guess a data point that is missing in the input data.

Machine learning is about engineering rules from the data itself and not from expert knowledge. The benefit of machine learning is that it automates the creation of rules from the data.

## Supervised machine learning

In supervised machine learning, the data is annotated. The purpose of supervised learning is to predict a target class on new data without annotation.

We're in the presence of a supervised learning problem when we have some information about the target variable in the training dataset.

### Classification

In classification, the target class is categorical, as discrete, it is made of different classes.

### Regression

In regression, the target class is continuous, as a real number, it is a numerical quantity.

## Unsupervised machine learning

In unsupervised machine learning, the data is not annotated. The goal is to extract from the input data a structure that generalizes.
