Falsificationism is a theory of philosophy of science proposed by the philosopher Karl Popper. 

It states that science progresses through a process of falsifying hypotheses. According to Popper, for a theory to be considered scientific, it must be able to be tested and potentially proven false. This provocative view of science emphasizes on refutation rather than confirmation through evidence.

Popper thinks that no amount of experimental observations can ever conclusively verify a universal statement (like "all swans are white") because itâ€™s impossible to observe all instances. However, it takes only one contradicting instance (like finding a black swan) to falsify it.

Popper believed that science progresses by bold conjectures that are subjected to rigorous testing. When a theory is falsified, it's either discarded or revised, leading to better and more refined theories.

One famous historical example of falsificationism is the shift to a Newtonian model of physics to an Einsteinian one.

Falsificationism implies that scientific knowledge is always provisional and open to revision. This keeps science dynamic and self-correcting. Falsification provides a clear criterion to differentiate between scientific and non-scientific theories. If a theory cannot be tested in a way that it could be proven false, Popper would regard it as non-scientific.
