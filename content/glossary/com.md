COM stands for Component Object Model. It is a binary-interface standard for software components introduced by Microsoft in 1993. It allows different software components to communicate and interact with each other, regardless of the language they were written in. This is achieved by defining the interfaces between objects in a language-neutral way, with the interfaces described in a metadata format, and accessed through a runtime system. COM objects can be created with a variety of programming languages. Object-oriented languages, such as C++, provide programming mechanisms that simplify the implementation of COM objects.

In COM, aggregate objects can be created: they are a higher-level object that contains and controls one or more other objects. These sub objects can then be called from the outside as if they were part of the aggregate object itself.
